Players are granted access to basic tools and colors to design their clothes with at first, and can only design one side of the clothing. It�s all about gathering materials, which can be found in all campground locations and then using them to craft the clothing items listed in the events section.</p>
<h3 id="pocket-camp-as-the-same-user-across-multiple-devices">Pocket Camp As The Same User Across Multiple Devices.</h3><p>Place your order, and mabel and the rest of the crew will take care of things for you. Clothes crafting will be similar to crafting furniture, with players calling mabel instead of cyrus. If you have a lot of each, you can simply narrow them by categories, by simply tapping the corresponding button. Pocket camp players can create furniture for their very own campsite, make friends with classic animal crossing characters, go fishing, purchase different outfits, customize.</p>
<h3 id="she-can-be-located-in-the-market">She Can Be Located In The Market.</h3><p>To expand the number of items you can craft at once, tap the plus icon that hovers above the work bench on the crafting screen. The last option is to craft the clothes yourself, but clicking on that option currently only shows a message that the feature will be “coming soon.” that is. All you have to do is ask! Pocket camp next week will take care of everything.</p>
