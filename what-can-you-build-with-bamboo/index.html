To make a bamboo teepee, insert one end each of three or more bamboo poles into the earth, then lash them all together at the top with some twine. Even though some may call it a bunch of sticks, bamboo is used for constructing everything from furniture to walls, and from roofs to floors. This simple teepee is ideal for climbing plants such as pole beans or morning glories.</p>
