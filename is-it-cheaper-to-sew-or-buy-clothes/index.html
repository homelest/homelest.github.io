If you enjoy sewing and want a custom piece, but all means, but overall, it won�t save.</p>
<h3 id="in-some-cases-yes-it-is-cheaper-to-make-your-own-baby-clothes">In Some Cases, Yes, It Is Cheaper To Make Your Own Baby Clothes.</h3><p>I wanted to keep this post strictly as a comparison between sewing new clothes. To make one you’d need thread. I�d think that it�s be more economical in the long run to find fabric on sale &amp; sew your on covers to put on already purchased pillows. I compare the cost of making a dress to buying one on the uk high street.</p>
