How Long Will my VHS Tapes Last Nowhere Video From youtube.com
Factors that determine the lifespan of a tape are the quality of the tape, how many times it was played, and if the tapes are stored and exposed to factors like heat, cold, and humidity. I have one from the late eighties. I don�t know how common that is though. Short answer — no one really knows.

This figure may vary with the age of the cassettes, as the most durable tapes were manufactured in the 1970s and 1980s; Dvds do not degrade in this way and last much longer.
