9 Easy jewwelry making ideas jewelry projects, beaded jewelry From pinterest.co.uk
Painted bead necklace let your imagination run wild as you’re holding a paintbrush and decorating the beads that will be a part of your diy necklace. Push the beads down push the beads downwards after the beads are pushed down, go ahead and cut the wire from the other end of your necklace. This is super easy—just loop the wire back through two beads (as you see above), and then use your crimping pliers to crimp the beads, flattening them until they permanently hold the two wires together. Choosing the right needle is really important—you want it to be thin enough where the needle will fit through the hole in the beads and have the eye be large enough for the cording to fit through.
