<h3 id="subscribe-to-my-youtube-channel-here">Subscribe To My Youtube Channel Here!</h3><p>Create the design follow my tutorial for cricut design space to create any kind of label or design you want. I then selected both shapes and attached them, then you�ll choose to flatten them. They also proudly mark the clothes sewn by me as my own. Whether you want labels to help organize your pantry or fridge, or if you want to label your handmade creations to sell, using a cricut to make vinyl labels is such a fun and beautiful solution!</p>
<h3 id="did-you-know-you-could-make-labels-with-your-cric">Did You Know You Could Make Labels With Your Cric.</h3><p>I did it for the green and the pink labels. You can create these labels in any size, color, and font you’d like which means the labeling possibilities are virtually endless! Next select move to front. Once you’ve cut out the design you need to weed it.</p>
