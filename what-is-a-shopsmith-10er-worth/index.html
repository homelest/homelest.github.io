Shopsmith 10ER IFish Fishing Forum From ifish.net
As the title says, is this a 10er? The price is a bit high ($1100.00) but it looks really trick. I see them listed for $300 many times, and that includes some accessories. Now at $170 the going rate around here for a complete unit in good condition with some accessories is $50 to $75.
