But if you know you�re making chicken soup, you might as well go ahead and add a teaspoon of kosher salt for every three cups of water you add to the instant pot. However, you can also add as much water as you want depending on your taste. For every 1 cup of soup, add 1/2 cup of nutritional yeast.</p>
<h3 id="if-you-dont-want-to-water-the-soup-down-you-may-add-one-or-two-unseasoned-potatoes-and-simmer-them-in-the-mix">If You Don’t Want To Water The Soup Down, You May Add One Or Two Unseasoned Potatoes And Simmer Them In The Mix.</h3><p>Seasoning properly is critical for optimum flavour in all cooking but especially. Keeping this in mind, you can easily prepare condensed soup by adding water to it and then heating the can. Stir the milk and soup mixture slowly and let it heat for a few minutes. Say you have prepared a mixed curry or a vietnamese chicken noodle soup but have added too much salt.</p>
<h3 id="from-there-you-add-the-stock-water-or-both-and-begin-to-layer-the-vegetables-according-to-how-long-they-will-need-to-cook">From There, You Add The Stock, Water, Or Both And Begin To Layer The Vegetables According To How Long They Will Need To Cook.</h3><p>Opt for water if you are looking to avoid those additional calories and fat. Put brown or wild rice in a pot along with other soup ingredients and add enough water (at least 4 quarters of water for 1 quarter of rice.) because rice will absorb plenty of liquid in the soup. Measure about 1/4 cup of whole milk, 2 percent milk or skim milk for every cup of tomato soup. It will likely explode and cause a kitchen fire.</p>
