You can also decorate the cake plate with washi tape too!</p>
<h3 id="use-it-on-glass-jars-napkins-plates-straws-napkins-food-picks-and-bunting">Use It On Glass Jars, Napkins, Plates, Straws, Napkins, Food Picks And Bunting.</h3><p>Well, it’s extremely durable and reusable enough that you can reuse it again and again with different designs each time! Lay flat on your table with the sticky side up (plastic sheet down.) affix two strips of washi tape straight down the middle. Washi tape is supposed to be low tack and removable. The word “washi” comes from the japanese words “wa,” which means “japanese,” and “shi,” which means “paper.” washi tape is often used for decorative purposes, as it comes in a variety of colors and patterns.</p>
<h3 id="the-adhesive-in-washi-can-be-made-of-acrylic-rubber-or-anything-that-does-not-bind-as-hard-as-typical-adhesive-substances">The Adhesive In Washi Can Be Made Of Acrylic, Rubber Or Anything That Does Not Bind As Hard As Typical Adhesive Substances.</h3><p>Plus it’s easy to remove without causing damage. Another element to consider is that washi tape is reusable. Each roll of washi tape is 0.59inch (1.5cm) in width x 23ft (7m) in length. Even though it’s waterproof and robust, you may easily shred it with your hands.</p>
