<h3 id="noticeable-when-viewed-under-a-microscope-the-beaded-appearance-is-due-to-periodic-narrowing-of-the-hair-shaft">Noticeable When Viewed Under A Microscope, The Beaded Appearance Is Due To Periodic Narrowing Of The Hair Shaft.</h3><p>The term monilethrix is derived from the latin word monile, which means necklace, and the greek word thrix, which means hair.

The name monilethrix comes from the latin word for necklace (monile) and the greek word for hair (thrix). Monilethrix is characterized by a beaded appearance of the hair due to periodic thinning of the shaft. Many factors can cause hair breakage, including hair styling methods, products, diet, and stress.</p>
