So in this video i try double eyelid tape, i cannot rock these but if you do know how to apply these properly please let me know! Given the level of difficulty in applying the tape, we can be forgiven for thinking leaving the tape on for long periods of time could somehow change the shape of your eyes. If it doesn�t hold, remove and apply adhesive.</p>
<h3 id="look-into-the-mirror-and-figure-out-where-your-natural-crease-is">Look Into The Mirror And Figure Out Where Your Natural Crease Is.</h3><p>It does make your eyelid become double, but the bad thing is everyone can see the eyelid tape as picture below, it become more obvious when you closed. Step 4 to ensure that the tape “sinks” in better, push the shaping stick into the lid just above the crease. However, there are many risks and other problems associated with surgery. Make sure the tape is slightly shorter than the length of your eye so it does not stick out on both ends.</p>
