Believe it or not, there are models with a collection of tattoos who make their way on to the catwalk and have modeled for designers such as dolce and gabbana, chanel, dior and more. There are photographers who love models with tattoos. Fashion knows no limits and the tattooed models that rule the runway are proof that even karl lagerfeld can�t deny that tattoos add cool factor.</p>
<h3 id="not-everyone-will-tell-you-to-cover-it-up-but-i-will">Not Everyone Will Tell You To Cover It Up, But I Will.</h3><p>We are happy to say that the answer is yes! If you’re a model with a tattoo you can expect to be asked that new aged question of its location and size. Taboo was replaced by fashion. Take your time never get a tattoo on a.</p>
