<h3 id="use-a-scraper-to-burnish-transfer-tape-onto-your-design-working-outward-from-where-you-attached-the-small-area">Use A Scraper To Burnish Transfer Tape Onto Your Design, Working Outward From Where You Attached The Small Area.</h3><p>Remember to keep this so you can put the transfer tape back on it for use later. You can use either smart vinyl or regular vinyl (with a mat). Use a scraper to burnish transfer tape onto your design, working outward from where you attached the small area. Additionally, cricut offers transfer tape in long, narrow rolls now, perfect for cricut joy projects using smart vinyl!</p>
