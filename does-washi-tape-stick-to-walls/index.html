Unlike other tapes, washi tape will almost always remove cleanly from your walls.</p>
<h3 id="thats-especially-true-if-youre-renting-and-you-cant-paint-or-nail-anything-to-the-wall">That’s Especially True If You’re Renting And You Can’t Paint Or Nail Anything To The Wall.</h3><p>This is a little bit nuanced because washi tape will definitely still stick to your walls (or whatever else you put it on). Because washi tape does not stick permanently to the walls, it’s a cinch to periodically change up your style to keep up with the latest home décor trends. Washi tape frames are easy to put up, and won’t leave marks on your walls when you take them down. We’ve used washi tape to hang a few lightweight paper sketches to our walls, and they’ve been hanging for over a month.</p>
<h3 id="unlike-tapes-with-a-tackier-adhesive-washi-tape-will-come-off-the">Unlike Tapes With A Tackier Adhesive, Washi Tape Will Come Off The.</h3><p>Washi tape made in china also can also sometimes leave residue on surfaces. It has a low tack adhesive property and is usually made from natural fibers such as bamboo making it easy to remove from most walls. Washi tape is safe for walls. Unfortunately, none of them will be kind to your walls when the time comes to remove them.</p>
