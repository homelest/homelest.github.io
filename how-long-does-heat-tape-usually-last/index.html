<p>When this moisture heats up, trapped between the heat source (header) and the wrap, it superheats. Most heat tape manufacturers warn that you should replace your heat tapes every 3 years minimum.

<p>It would be stupid to heat trace it without insulating after. If the heat tape is wrapped around a pipe (full of water) that remains shut off for winter and that in turn is covered with insulation, the temperature can go much higher compared with the heat tape hanging in free air like a strip of flypaper. Refer to your heat tape�s instructions before doing this. Fiberglass Mesh Tape for Wall Materials realtime quotes.</p>

<p>This tape is just like an insulator, like electrical tape, but it can resist temperatures as high as 258°c (496°f). The heat on the outside portion of the header material is trapped between the wrap, and the small amounts of moisture that develop will soon cause the header to fatigue.

<p>If the heat tape fails to warm up, after 10 minutes, the thermostat or the heat tape itself is bad.

Most heat tape manufacturers warn that you should replace your heat tapes every 3 years minimum. It would be stupid to heat trace it without insulating after. You can cut the heat tape and install a plug or terminator just after the bump to shorten the tape.</p>

This tape is just like an insulator, like electrical tape, but it can resist temperatures as high as 258°c (496°f). Once folks give you an idea of life span for a heat tape, if you are near it, you may want to consider replacing the heat tape on a nice dry summer day.</p>
