Dowels are round wooden pins of small diameter used to strengthen (reinforce) a joint.</p>
<h3 id="using-a-wider-dowel-would-weaken-the-board-and-a-narrower-dowel-would-not-be-strong-enough-to-hold-the-joint">Using A Wider Dowel Would Weaken The Board, And A Narrower Dowel Would Not Be Strong Enough To Hold The Joint.</h3><p>I wipe the wooden dowel down with everclear and then rub it liberally with shortening, disinfecting and then sealing the wood.

<h3 id="if-dowels-remain-in-some-holes-and-wont-budge-try-to-loosen-them-with-a-few-drops-of-alcohol">If Dowels Remain In Some Holes And Won’t Budge, Try To Loosen Them With A Few Drops Of Alcohol.</h3><p>They are more for alignment, where the dowels will add a good deal of strength. 2) then try drops of alcohol.

<h3 id="they-can-be-bought-ready-made-and-can-be-used-instead-of-nails-or-screws-or-instead-of-mortising-dovetailing-etc">They Can Be Bought Ready Made And Can Be Used Instead Of Nails Or Screws, Or Instead Of Mortising, Dovetailing, Etc.</h3><p>Let it soak in for a few minutes to dissolve the glue. Use acetone or denatured alcohol if you suspect the joint was glued with epoxy or urethane. In my use of biscuits they are designed to keep joints from pulling apart. Next, sand the wood with a fine grit sandpaper until it�s smooth, then grease it with a food safe oil, such as canola oil.</p>
