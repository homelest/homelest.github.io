Best paint colours for almond or bone bathroom fixtures From kylieminteriors.ca
The best paint to use on bathroom cabinets is an alkyd based paint. Both latex and oil paint require a coat of primer on your vanity before painting. It is a great, chic match to the natural wood floor and shiny metallic details. Even if it does not have paint, it may have been stained a certain color and may be even had a coat of wax or varnish applied.
