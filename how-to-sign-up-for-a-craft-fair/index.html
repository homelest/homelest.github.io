<h3 id="check-that-out-here-if-youre-looking-for-more-ways-to-increase-sales-at-craft-shows">Check That Out Here If You’re Looking For More Ways To Increase Sales At Craft Shows.</h3><p>Here are a few event listing sites: A few weeks before the fair is run send an email to each exhibitor reminding them about it, along with any important information, such as a map, the time the venue is available for them to set up, the opening and closing time for visitors and any rules. Vendors can then provide their company name, items to be sold, seller’s permit number, and other important business details through your form. When you�re first starting out, it�s important to tread the craft fair and art show waters carefully, staying as close to the shallow end as possible before diving into the deep end and trying to swim with the big fish, you know, like the folks who tour the fair and show circuit for a living.</p>
