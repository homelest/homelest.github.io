Liner, no liner, gridded or not gridded I bought this twice thinking the first roll was just a bad roll, but both were garbage. They allow you to easily move your vinyl design from it’s paper backing to your final project.</p>
<h3 id="pull-that-tab-away-from-the-sticky-edge-to-remove-the-backing-and-at-the-same-time-take-your-scraper-or-your-hand-and-smooth-the-transfer-tape-down-in-a-line-across-the-center">Pull That Tab Away From The Sticky Edge To Remove The Backing, And, At The Same Time, Take Your Scraper Or Your Hand And Smooth The Transfer Tape Down In A Line Across The Center.</h3><p>Here is a super brief wrap up of how each of the brands of transfer tape performed: It doesn�t stick to anything. Yes, you’ll get some fuzzies on it but it’ll take some of the stick away and might help you on your first transfer. Flipping the entire thing over and burnishing from the back twice.</p>
<h3 id="there-was-only-one-small-piece-that-did-not-pick-up-from-the-vinyl-the-first-time">There Was Only One Small Piece That Did Not Pick Up From The Vinyl The First Time.</h3><p>If you have cleaned your surface well with rubbing alcohol but your vinyl is still not sticking, try leaving the transfer tape on the vinyl for a bit after applying it onto the surface. It is very similar to masking tape. The new transfer tape you will receive is clear with blue grid and completely useless. Paper tape and clear or transparent tape.</p>
