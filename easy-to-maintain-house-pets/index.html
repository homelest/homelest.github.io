<h3 id="the-cage-should-be-kept-indoors-as-theyre-prone-to-heatstroke-in-sunny-conditions">The Cage Should Be Kept Indoors As They’re Prone To Heatstroke In Sunny Conditions;</h3><p>They are typically healthy pets, though some may inherit or develop heart issues. Raisins are, however, a favorite treat of most chinchillas! I will be honest and say that i didn’t do this at the beginning, my dog is extremely scared of groomers so i had to learn how to groom him myself. Pets can be entertaining, and it is nice to have a companion around the house — and these are low maintenance pets that like to cuddle too!2.</p>
