<h3 id="no-it-will-not-hold">No, It Will Not Hold.</h3><p>Most drywall tradesmen will say that paper tape is stronger than mesh drywall tape. This will ensure the results are on par with what you require. It’s recommended to apply a primer to cover the tape before applying paint. You can use your fingers instead of the block.</p>
<h3 id="plaster-can-fill-gaps-and-smooth-out-the-texture-of-the-wall-but-it039s-the-drywall-tape-that-holds-it-together-as-one-seamless-surface">Plaster Can Fill Gaps, And Smooth Out The Texture Of The Wall, But It�s The Drywall Tape That Holds It Together As One Seamless Surface.</h3><p>Lay new drywall tape over any areas from which you removed tape. Can you paint over drywall tape? If you skipped the drywall tape and just used joint compound to fill in the seams, the seams would become visible again after the compound dried. You should make sure that everything is as smooth as possible and then give it 24 hours to fully dry out.</p>
<h3 id="so-in-a-sense-you-do-paint-over-it-but-only-after-your-mud-is-smoothed-dried-and-then-sanded">So, In A Sense, You Do Paint Over It, But Only After Your Mud Is Smoothed, Dried, And Then Sanded.</h3><p>This is because taping only reinforces the joint, seam, or repair work. Attach the tape and cover well with the mud. The choice of drywall tape is entirely up to you, but if using the paper tape, the joint has to be coated with a layer of mud first, filling the cracks as you go along. Additionally, can you use mesh tape with joint compound?</p>
