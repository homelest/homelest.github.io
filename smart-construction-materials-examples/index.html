Materials like nanomaterial, biomimetic material are all set to transform the erstwhile concrete in the form of a second skin. Five examples of existing smart buildings have been selected in order to demonstrate these different aspects. Bridge made of high performance concrete 1.2 light transmitting concrete the days of dull, grey concrete could be about to end.
