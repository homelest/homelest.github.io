Mod podge a 6×6 picture on them. All you require for this build are your wood blocks of choice, and an area of land next to the water. As a bonus, most make a great gift idea.</p>
<h3 id="p-pickyourplum-wood-block-ideas-pick-your-plum">P Pickyourplum Wood Block Ideas Pick Your Plum</h3><p>Why stop with just building blocks that stand? Some i’ve bought new, some i’ve dumpster dived, most i’ve thrifted, but it all amounts to a hell of a collection for my little kids, who can build themselves a hell of a building block fort over the course of a rainy weekend, thanks to me. Mod podge all 6 sides with different pictures. Relax in style with this rustic wood bathtub tray.</p>
