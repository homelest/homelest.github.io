I have a 6 wrist and when i want a small bracelet to sit right at my wrist comfortably (like a seed bead bracelet ), iï¿½ll make it 6.5. Find out your bracelet size in 4 easy steps using at home tools. Once the ruler is cut out, wrap it around your wrist and tighten it so it fits comfortably.</p>
<h3 id="so-you-might-want-to-measure-your-wrist-with-your-hands-open">So You Might Want To Measure Your Wrist With Your Hands Open.</h3><p>We go by the inside circle circumference of the bracelet, and not by how long the bracelet is. If you donât have a measuring tape, you can use a simple piece of string or a sheet of paper. To ensure the bracelet fits comfortably, add 1.5 cm. It is important to use a thin, flat paper strip.</p>
