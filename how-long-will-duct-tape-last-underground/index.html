<h3 id="duct-tape-is-the-true-top-of-the-line-a-high-tensile-hardworking-tape">Duct Tape Is The True Top Of The Line, A High Tensile, Hardworking Tape.</h3><p>Approximately how long does duct tape last? Keep wood from splitting with duct tape when cutting plywood, first reinforce where you plan on cutting with a strip of duct tape. Make sure the surface is dry before you apply the tape, and we’re sure you’ll find this out for yourself. If there is a lot of water leaking out then duct tape will not work and will be almost useless.</p>
