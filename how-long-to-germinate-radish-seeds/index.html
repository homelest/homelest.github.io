<h3 id="soil-moisture-available-oxygen-temperature-seed-viability-seed-depth-ph-salinity-and-seed-vitality">Soil Moisture, Available Oxygen, Temperature, Seed Viability, Seed Depth, Ph, Salinity, And Seed Vitality.</h3><p>For outdoor planting, put the seeds in a pot, but put a thin layer of gravel over the top of the pot to prevent the soil from being washed away. Seeds should germinate in 4 to 10 days at an optimal temperature of 70Â°f (21c) or greater; The only sure way to know when itâs safe to plant is to take the soilâs temperature. The average width of the plant stem is.125 and weight is 1.5 grams.</p>
