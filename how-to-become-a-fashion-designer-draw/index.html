<h3 id="art-and-design-schools-always-offer-bfas-and-some-also-have-ba-programs">Art And Design Schools Always Offer Bfas And Some Also Have Ba Programs.</h3><p>You�ll also need to create a strong fashion portfolio and strengthen your knowledge of business and finance in general. Learn about the different designers that exist (and have existed). If you want to become a fashion designer, you will have to choose between attending an art and design school or a traditional liberal arts college, and earning a bfa (bachelor of fine arts) degree or a ba (bachelor of arts) degree. Whether you prefer to study separately or through an approved bachelor�s degree program is up to you.</p>
<h3 id="drawing-is-no-longer-a-prerequisite-to-becoming-a-fashion-designer">Drawing Is No Longer A Prerequisite To Becoming A Fashion Designer.</h3><p>You’ll also want to study fashion itself. Most fashion programs are three to four years long. If you are not sketching your designs you will need to be able to use a computer to mock up your designs. In fact, it is required within the industry that you are able to create digital designs at some point in the design process.</p>
<h3 id="you-can-also-think-about-how-you-would-adjust-or-style-a-garment-to-suit-different-styles-and-audiences">You Can Also Think About How You Would Adjust Or Style A Garment To Suit Different Styles And Audiences.</h3><p>To become a fashion designer, you will need to have a combination of drawing, sewing, and design skills, a knowledge of the fashion industry, and unparalleled perseverance. Leave some space at the bottom of your page for the feet. Draw two lines upward from the top of the pelvic square to create the torso. With digital drawing and sketching, visualising your design becomes easier than ever.</p>
