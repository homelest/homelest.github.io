<h3 id="probably-the-biggest-concern-for-failure-would-be-simply-good-old-wood-movement">Probably The Biggest Concern For Failure Would Be Simply Good Old Wood Movement.</h3><p>Ten steps to make your own wood fired hot tub. Install side walls at right angles to the floor, but angle the back of the tub so that is comfortable to lean against. The small wooden hot tub made at home can easily accommodate a single person and once again it is wood that provides the source of heat as well. Itâs an ideal design for those with limited budgets, and since it doesnât take up too much space, itâs perfect if you donât have room for anything bigger.</p>
