Install side walls at right angles to the floor, but angle the back of the tub so that is comfortable to lean against. The small wooden hot tub made at home can easily accommodate a single person and once again it is wood that provides the source of heat as well. It’s an ideal design for those with limited budgets, and since it doesn’t take up too much space, it’s perfect if you don’t have room for anything bigger.</p>
