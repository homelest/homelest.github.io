<h3 id="high-fashion-models-are-typically-5039850399-with-few-exceptions-and-have-measurements-of-around-33">High Fashion Models Are Typically 5�8/5�9+ (With Few Exceptions) And Have Measurements Of Around 33.</h3><p>This cannot be stressed enough. Once you cut your fabric, that’s it, it’s over, so you better measure twice and cut once to make sure that you don’t ruin any of your fabric and that you’re cutting exactly what you need to be cutting. Heels instantly give you better posture, making you look taller, slimmer, and more confident. Models must be able to take direction from photographers and clients during photo shoots and commercials.</p>
<h3 id="the-client-wants-to-see-the-natural-beauty-of-the-model">The Client Wants To See The Natural Beauty Of The Model.</h3><p>Many models practice walking tall by balancing a book on their heads. Plus, they prove you can walk in heels—a must for every model. This is something that a good agent will be able to determine and send you to the correct modeling auditions. Eat and drink healthy foods and get plenty of exercise.</p>
