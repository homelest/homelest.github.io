What is indie style clothing? Quora From quora.com

If a unique style doesn’t have any retro or classic qualities people are more likely to call it eclectic or eccentric. It does refer to any particular style. Not everyone wants to look the same and stick to the typical mainstream fashions, and that’s exactly where indie clothing makes itself known by offering some different designs that aren’t too crazy to wear on a daily basis but still have the ability to make you stand out from the crowd on a night out.
