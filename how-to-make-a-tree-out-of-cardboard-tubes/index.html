My favorite part of fall is the brilliant explosion of color as the trees embrace the season. This is a quick and easy one (my favorite kind!). Create an entire toilet paper roll choir with this christmas carollers craft.</p>
<h3 id="gt-cut-two-opposite-slits-into-the-cardboard-tube-and-slide-the-green-card-into-the-slits">&gt; Cut Two Opposite Slits Into The Cardboard Tube And Slide The Green Card Into The Slits.</h3><p>It’s so easy to make these 3d paper plate christmas trees with the help of paper plates and cardboard tubes. Whether it�s paper towel rolls or toilet paper tubes, we have hundreds of cardboard tube crafts for you to choose from! Starting at the top of the paper towel tube, make rows with hot glue. If you don’t have a stash of your own, and you want to buy cardboard tubes for crafting in bulk, you can order them here on amazon with my affiliate link.</p>
