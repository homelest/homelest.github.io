<h3 id="if-you-will-be-getting-your-images-from-the-internet-set-up-a-board-on-pinterest-or-similar-a-bookmarks">If You Will Be Getting Your Images From The Internet, Set Up A Board On Pinterest (Or Similar), A Bookmarks.</h3><p>Mood boards help to ground their creativity and provide a sense of structure to their ideas. Depending on your project, however, you may find you only need one or two of these elements. A mood board is a collection of images, colors and fonts that perfectly defines what a project is about.
