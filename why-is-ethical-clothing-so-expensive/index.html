<h3 id="there-are-many-reasons-to-participate-in-the-slow-fashion-movement-and-start-shopping-sustainably-but-the-greatest-barrier-is-its-financial-cost">There Are Many Reasons To Participate In The “Slow Fashion” Movement And Start Shopping Sustainably, But The Greatest Barrier Is Its Financial Cost.</h3><p>And it was the main reason why i fought the idea of ethical fashion for a long time.
