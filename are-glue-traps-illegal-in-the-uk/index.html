But not in the uk, which claims to have the highest animal welfare standards in the world. It would be an offence for a person to allow or permit someone else to set the trap. A private members’ bill proposing a ban on glue traps is due for a second reading in westminster on 19 november, and the uk government has promised to hold a call for evidence on the use of snares in response to a petition, supported by peta, calling for a ban.</p>
