While this method is a great scrap buster, the first few times you try it might be frustrating.</p>
<h3 id="this-is-easy-to-do-if-you-finish-your-armholes-with-a-band-or-binding-rather-than-a-dart">This Is Easy To Do If You Finish Your Armholes With A Band Or Binding Rather Than A Dart.</h3><p>Mark the armhole about one inch past this. Step 4 if you have an opening at the back neck, fold the ends of the binding inwards &amp; press to secure in place. At the finishing end, i trimmed excess binding as needed to leave about 3/8 inch to fold under itself and sewed in it place up against the first edge. Mark the location of any notches, and intersecting seams, and add a seam allowance to the ends where the binding is to be joined.</p>
<h3 id="while-gently-stretching-the-knit-binding-i-sewed-it-in-place-with-an-extremely-narrow-zig-zag-hem">While Gently Stretching The Knit Binding, I Sewed It In Place With An Extremely Narrow Zig Zag Hem.</h3><p>Fold in half lengthwise press. Technically, you can’t bind off at the end of the row. Leave a gap at the bottom of the armhole, at the underarm seam, and a few inches of bias tape trailing on each side of the gap. Take a tape measure and measure around the armhole.</p>
<h3 id="open-out-the-binding-so-that-both-folds-are-unfolded-and-sew-these-two-ends-together-at-the-point-at-which-you-placed-the-pin">Open Out The Binding So That Both Folds Are Unfolded And Sew These Two Ends Together At The Point At Which You Placed The Pin.</h3><p>Turn the armhole around so you can work from the inside. Sew from the wrong side at 1/4″ so you can sew directly on top of your stay stitching. Fold the binding over and pin into place on the inside. Decreases are made in the beginning of the knit and purl rows accordingly.</p>
