The glue used in sticky fly traps is pretty tough, but you can get rid of it with a few simple oils you may already have in your house. Hi all,i am new to home care and have a recently discharged from rehab patient who has a lot of adhesive left on his skin from telemetry monitoring. Use small, circular motions to loosen stubborn tape deposits, then rinse with cool water and repeat if necessary.</p>
<h3 id="cover-the-area-with-a-damp-cloth">Cover The Area With A Damp Cloth.</h3><p>Moisture or warmth makes the adhesive in the tape residue more pliable. Isopropyl alcohol (either the 70% or 91% it doesn�t matter) works wonders for cleaning the skin, whether it is tape residue or pen ink. In fact, the following two methods are found to be good: Lay a towel below a flat surface, and then place your silk on the surface.</p>
<h3 id="the-trick-is-to-either-heat-the-glue-so-it-softens-or-smother-it-in-oil">The Trick Is To Either Heat The Glue So It Softens Or Smother It In Oil.</h3><p>Use small, circular motions to loosen the adhesive. The important thing is to get the oil on a clean cloth and rub the skin with the glue gently. This has worked for me, but try at your own risk! Using one or two fingers from one hand, hold the skin firmly in front of the tape where you are going to peel off and gently start peeling back the tape and the tape peels further back, move your finger/s that are holding the skin down further along the path of the peeled tape and continue holding the skin down in front of the peeled tape.</p>
