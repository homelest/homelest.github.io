<h3 id="50-to-100-an-hour-but-i-charge-per-project">$50 To $100 An Hour, But I Charge Per Project.</h3><p>Web developers earn around $70,000 annually. According to data from stack overflow’s 2020 developer survey —an extensive study with more than 65,000 developers participating—annual freelance web developer salaries vary by about $10,000 per year based on the type of web developer. Yes you can make money from web development and you can make a lot. Last time i checked that’s a really frickin’ big market.</p>
<h3 id="in-the-us-the-average-salary-is-around-84000-or-40-per-hour-without-including-the-value-of-benefits">In The U.s., The Average Salary Is Around $84,000, Or $40 Per Hour, Without Including The Value Of Benefits.</h3><p>Taking courses or attending boot camps is not necessary. Its not fair to make less the more experienced you are, and for a beginner to get more billable hours. It’s easy to look at these projects and think the latter is worth more money. With a bit of research, it’s fair to conclude that the average freelance web developer salary per hour is about $60.</p>
