<h3 id="you-can-rent-a-wedding-dress--heres-how">You Can Rent A Wedding Dress — Here’s How</h3><p>Decide on how short you want the dress and add 1/4 inch to that length. I made my own wedding dress! Bustling a dress is not as simple as it may sound. For instance my dress needed 4 inches off the bottom so i went around marking 4 inches from the bottom.</p>
<h3 id="crank-the-heat-in-the-shower-take-your-time-and-get-the-room-full-of-steamthis-is-really-all-some-gowns-need">Crank The Heat In The Shower, Take Your Time, And Get The Room Full Of Steam—This Is Really All Some Gowns Need!</h3><p>Then you have to hang the dress high in the air and sit inside of it to sew the hem so that it lays properly. Make sure you have the cleaning supplies you will need. This is what your markings should look like. It was ivory satin with only a little bit of beading around the bodice.</p>
<h3 id="i-added-new-narrow-lace-to-the-edge-of-the-ruffle">I Added New Narrow Lace To The Edge Of The Ruffle.</h3><p>Look over the dress for any stains, taking into account what the stain consists of. Step 1, perform a thorough inspection of your dress. The pieces don’t have to be on the bias but it gives the finished ruffle a nice fluidity. Start by disinfecting and cleaning the bath to prevent any residue transferring onto your dress.</p>
