<h3 id="in-theory-yes-however-there-are-some-rookie-mistakes-you-are-bound-to-make-if-it-is-your-first-time">In Theory Yes, However, There Are Some Rookie Mistakes You Are Bound To Make If It Is Your First Time.</h3><p>Work it in for a few seconds. Apply conditioner and massage it into the tape pieces to loosen the stickiness. Remember not to tug on the extensions, tape in extensions are notoriously known to be reusable so using the right solution and efficiently removing the extensions can save you from buying another set of tape in extension the next time you want to use one. Gently rub so that the liquid gets between the tape sections.</p>
<h3 id="you-dont-want-to-overdo-it-because-then-youll-have-weird-bulges-in-your-hair">You Don’t Want To Overdo It Because Then You’ll Have Weird Bulges In Your Hair.</h3><p>Start peeling off the hair strands. Work it in with your thumb and fingers, and gently pull the two pieces of tape apart like two pieces of velcro. If done right, the teased layers of hair will have the role of a wall that you cannot see through. To remove the tape extensions, use a few drops of remover between the two strands applied.</p>
