If you’re trying to decide when to plant radishes in zone 7 and up, the seedlings are safe to move outdoors anytime after the danger of frost passes. The best month to plant radishes will depend on whether you are sowing seed direct outdoors, starting off the seeds under glass, and also the climate where you live. Once seeds germinate and start their life as a seedling, they need ample bright light right away.</p>
