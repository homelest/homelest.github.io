<h3 id="make-it-modern-give-your-floating-shelves-a-fresh-unexpected-twist-by-taking-cues-from-this-modern-family-kitchen">Make It Modern Give Your Floating Shelves A Fresh, Unexpected Twist By Taking Cues From This Modern Family Kitchen.</h3><p>The first thing you’ll need to do is determine the length of your shelf.

You need 1/4″ plywood, 1 x 2 utility wood, 120 grit sandpaper, wood filler, paint, and primer.</p>
