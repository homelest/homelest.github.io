Right now headbands and wraps for fall are so in! Knowing which categories sell the most is great, but let’s talk about specific things to sell on etsy to make money. Even if none of the ten super easy crafts that we handpicked interest you, they may inspire you to invent your very own creation which is kind of what etsy is all about.</p>
<h3 id="but-dont-let-that-deter-you-as-etsy-shoppers-are-always-looking-for-unique-jewelry-pieces-to-add-to-their-own-wardrobe-or-to-gift-to-a-loved-one">But Don’t Let That Deter You As Etsy Shoppers Are Always Looking For Unique Jewelry Pieces To Add To Their Own Wardrobe Or To Gift To A Loved One.</h3><p>I picked up wooden spoons from the dollar store, so each of these cost $1 to make. If the items above you are already favorited by you, pick the ones above that until you reach 10. Happy crafting and happy selling! Dollar tree has a good selection of kitchen items like this, and this project is super creative and fun to make.</p>
