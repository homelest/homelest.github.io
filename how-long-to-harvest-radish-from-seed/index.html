Keep the ground moist if conditions are dry.</p>
<h3 id="sow-from-very-early-spring-initially-under-row-covers-or-hoop-houses-spacing-rows-about-8in-or-20cm-apart">Sow From Very Early Spring, Initially Under Row Covers Or Hoop Houses, Spacing Rows About 8In Or 20Cm Apart.</h3><p>The radish seeds germinate first and help make the soil softer for carrots. Pull one out and test it before harvesting the rest! By marking their date of maturity on the calendar, you can know that your radishes are likely to be ready or close to ready in that time frame. This is also affected by your soil type, the variety you are using, and weather conditions.</p>
<h3 id="this-applies-to-most-radish-varieties">This Applies To Most Radish Varieties.</h3><p>Just add a handful of compost and sow more radish seeds in the areas you�ve just harvested your first round from. Lift a few or push the soil aside gently to decide if they are large enough to harvest. Seeds will store for up to five years in a cool, dry area. Add a floating row cover to prevent maggots and flea beetles from attacking the seedlings.</p>
<h3 id="radishes-grow-very-quickly-and-for-some-varieties-you-can-harvest-as-early-as-three-weeks-from-their-planting-date">Radishes Grow Very Quickly, And For Some Varieties, You Can Harvest As Early As Three Weeks From Their Planting Date.</h3><p>Knowing what type of radish you are growing will tell you when to pick radishes. You can begin picking radishes when the roots are about an inch (2.5 cm.) across. How &amp; when to harvest radishes to remove from the soil, gently wiggle and pull the radish from the base of the leaves, removing the largest radishes. Radishes should be harvested rapidly, as early as 3 weeks after planting.</p>
