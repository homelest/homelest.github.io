<h3 id="it-starts-with-the-raw-materials">It Starts With The Raw Materials.</h3><p>While some clothing is donated and recycled, the majority of textile waste heads to our landfills where they release greenhouse gases and leach toxins and dyes into the surrounding soil and water. Many of the fashion industryâs negative environmental impacts stem from the production of the materials used to create clothing. According to the pulse of fashion report in 2015 the industry was responsible for 1,715 million tonnes of co 2 emissions. And water is one of the most precious and most abused commodities we have.</p>
<h3 id="so-how-can-we-make-the-fashion-industry-more-sustainable">So, How Can We Make The Fashion Industry More Sustainable?</h3><p>Of course, the fast fashion industry and its respective factories.

<h3 id="this-amount-of-waste-has-detrimental-effects-on-our-environment">This Amount Of Waste Has Detrimental Effects On Our Environment.</h3><p>Finishing is when chemicals or treatments are. Making it takes about 2,720 liters (719 gallons) of water. Cotton also requires a lot of water to grow. Allow money for more research into sustainable fabrics that have less impact on the environment boost the amount of recycling facilities in the uk support.</p>
