Dress to flatter your beautiful curves by following your bodyï¿½s outline. The raised waistline starts just below the bust, whichâparticularly when paired with an open neckline like this sweetheart styleâhelps lengthen both your upper body and torso. Your belly will always be prominent and will carry most of your excess weight (hence the name apple).</p>

Pants and slacks to balance the apple body shape the general rule with pants is that you will want to avoid the very skinny styles, though there are times to break the rules (like wearing leggings under a dress). In general, your bottoms should help balance out your legs to align more with the weight of your torso. Women with curves can end up revealing too much bust.</p>
